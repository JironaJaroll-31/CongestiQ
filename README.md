# CongestiQ

CongestiQ is an AI-based system designed to predict urban traffic congestion before it forms and classify the underlying cause of congestion.

## Problem Statement
AI-based system to predict and classify urban traffic congestion.

## Motivation
Most traffic systems react after congestion occurs. CongestiQ focuses on early prediction and cause identification to enable proactive traffic management.

## How It Works
- Learns normal traffic flow patterns
- Detects deviations in speed and density
- Predicts congestion probability
- Classifies congestion cause (behavioral, bottleneck, weather)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (for MVP)

## Status
This project is a working MVP developed as part of a 6-hour AI hackathon.
